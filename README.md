# Vagrant - or - how to code in your local computer 
## Learning Objectives
* What is a virtual machine
* What does “Ubuntu” mean
* How to use VMs with Vagrant

Sandboxes are great, but you can also do your ALX assessments on your local computer - having a virtual machine (VM) is the perfect tool for that. 
thanks .
